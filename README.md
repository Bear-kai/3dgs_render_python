Base on the original repo, we do the following:

- Add more detailed comments such as the explanation of [Jacobi](https://github.com/Bear-kai/3dgs_render_python/blob/17af6981f6f3dd118e6d5ee95507194698b69cce/render_python/raster.py#L88).

- Fix bugs or typos such as computing [axis_length](https://github.com/Bear-kai/3dgs_render_python/blob/17af6981f6f3dd118e6d5ee95507194698b69cce/3dgs.py#L181).

- Add tests about different styles of perspective projection matrix and related right/left hand coordinate system.

- Add visualization of ellipsoids/ellipses with random rotations by using matplotlib (also vpython).

    | ellipsoids | ellipses |
    |---|---|
    |<img src="assets\ellipsoid.png" width = 300 height = 200>| <img src="assets\3dgs_with_ellipse.png" width = 200 height = 200>|

- Still confuse about the sign of spherical harmonics cofficients [sh](https://github.com/Bear-kai/3dgs_render_python/blob/69994b2fce05c45fa147d589bc3ff8d875f905e4/render_python/sh.py#L36).

## üöÄ Introduction
**3dgs_render_python** is a project aimed at reimplementing the CUDA code part of [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) using Python. As a result, we have not only preserved the core functionality of the algorithm but also greatly enhanced the readability and maintainability of the code.

### üåà Advantages
- **Transparency**: Rewriting CUDA code in Python makes the internal logic of the algorithm clearer, facilitating understanding and learning.
- **Readability**: For beginners and researchers, this is an excellent opportunity to delve into parallel computing and 3DGS algorithms.

### üîç Disadvantages
- **Performance**: Since the project uses the CPU to simulate tasks originally handled by the GPU, the execution speed is slower than the native CUDA implementation.
- **Resource Consumption**: Simulating GPU operations with the CPU may lead to high CPU usage and memory consumption.

### üõ†Ô∏è Objective
The goal of this project is to provide an implementation of the 3DGS rendering part algorithm that is easier to understand and to offer a platform for users who wish to learn and experiment with 3D graphics algorithms without GPU hardware support.

## üìö Applicable Scenarios
- **Education and Research**: Providing the academic community with the opportunity to delve into the study of 3DGS algorithms.
- **Personal Learning**: Helping individual learners understand the complexities of parallel computing and 3DGS.

Through **3dgs_render_python**, we hope to stimulate the community's interest in 3D graphics algorithms and promote broader learning and innovation.
